# Product sales data analysis project with Excel

The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I got some data (attached), but didn‚Äôt have a chance to pull anything together and was hoping you could take a stab at it.

I think they just want to see Q2 2021 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. I think this file has what you need. I don‚Äôt remember all the region codes ‚Äì I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3 and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but I don‚Äôt remember which is which. I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest.


Conclusion

Q2 YoY growth slowed from Q1 growth of 4% down to 2.7% or ~13k in volume primarily driven by:
(7k) volume or 55% of the decline from loss of two customers in LATAM driving overall growth for region from 9% down im Q1 to flat in Q2 YoY
NAM client onboarding in Q2 2020 anniversaried in Q2 2021, slowing perceived growth and amplifying Q1 growth by ~5k units or 1%
